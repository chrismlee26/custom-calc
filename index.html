<!-- Create an HTML file
Name this file index.html
It should be in the root of your project folder
Write the base HTML document tags
Add tags and HTML markup for calculator elements
Bill - element: <input>
Tip - element: <input>
Number of people - element: <input>
Display tip - element: could be <h1-6>, <p>, <span>, <div>, or <output> you decide!
Display total - element: <h1-6>, <p>, <span>, <div>, or <output> you decide! -->




<!-- The inputs should have type="number".

All of the tags that need to be accessed by your JavaScript code should have an id. Remember all id values should be unique!

When writing the id names you’ll be repeating these names in your JS code so it would be a good idea to have a naming convention. Discuss your naming covention with another student.

Kabob case is a good choice for id names: kabob-case. All characters are lowercase and hyphen (-) is used at word breaks.

input-bill
input-tip
input-people
display-tip
display-total -->



<!-- Define variables for each of the elements. You’ll be creating references to DOM elements and storing them in variables in this step. You should have a naming convention.

Get the reference to the DOM element using document.querySelecotr('#id-name')

Use a naming convention for these variables, as you’ll need to keep track of them. Explain your naming convention to another student.

Use camelCase for these variable names. In camelcase names begin with a lower case letter and use upper case letters at word bbreaks.

const billInput = document.querySelector('#bill')


billInput
tipInput
peopleInput
displayTip
displayTotal -->


<!-- Add listeners to each of the input fields. These listeners should listen for the input event. A input event occurs when data input is detected at an input element. 
As a user enters text or numbers, as each new character is entered, the handler for this event is executed. -->
